## Project Workflow

1. Desktop app
   - This is made using an electron app with react integrated in it.
   - The passwords and the data is tored in local storage and is unencrypted.
   - Credentials are used as an alternative for Multi-Factor Authentication.

2. Web Deployable
   - This uses react as its frontend and java's spring boot framework for backend.
   - MySQL8 is used for database management.
   - Two tables are made one with user data and the other has password data mapped with users.
   - All data managed using JPA in spring boot and multiple API endpoints are set up for multiple uses like register, login, saving passwords etc.
   - The data stored is completely encrypted whether its user passwords or the passwords stored in the database.
   - The user account passswords include using sha256 hashing for encryption while for the saved passwords key based encryption is used.
